## Skills

In addition to the tech skills developed before and during my time at Makers Academy, I further enhanced my existing soft skills that will be transferable and beneficial within the tech industry.

### Soft Skills

#### **Problem-Solving**
When I joined the Estee Lauder branch in Harrods as Stock Coordinator I was tasked with solving the stock accuracy. I approached the problem by identifying the underlying cause(products were missing because deliveries were not checked against the paperwork) and worked around that by making sure that each delivery had its related paperwork and that the products'count was matching with the record in the system. I used to dedicate the first hours each morning to do a personal check, spot discrepancies and notify them to the buying managers to rectify the imbalance.  
In the first three months the accuracy of the stock was higher by 15% [61-76%] and by the four years of my employment, I helped grow the overall efficiency and accuracy of the stock management by 35% [61-96%].

During the [Acebook](https://github.com/samuelmbp/Acebook-nacho-libro) project at Makers Academy, our group experienced challenges implementing encrypted password storage to the database. To solve this problem, I researched, identified, and implemented an encryption method (BCrypt) that was capable of working with our project. To ensure members of the group did not run into this challenge in the future, I also shared this knowledge with the team and demonstrated how it works.
#### **Communication | Teamwork**

In my previous role as Stock Coordinator communication and teamwork were vital to better cooperate the stock management; we conducted detailed review procedures to value the stock correctly and therefore were able to make better operational decisions for the profitability of the business. 

<!-- I am an adaptable and dedicated team player, which has been evident throughout my professional career and during my time at Makers Academy. I have always thrived within a team environment, where collaboration and strong values are part of my work ethics and vital to ensuring a high performing organisation. -->

Completing the final two-week group project at Makers required a commitment to team work, communication, and building ways to work together within a high-pressure scenario in order to achieve a common goal. I collaborated via open discussions and critical thinking to determine the project focus and MVP features, and we used paired programming for front and back end development in order to support each other in learning and building within a new tech stack (MERN). I worked to cultivate patience, respect, and trust among group members, qualities that proved to be critical for our ability to rely on each other while completing different areas of the project. By using all of these skills, as a group, we succeeded collectively and implemented all the most important features of our application.


<!-- My previous role as a Stock Coordinator often included planning ahead; communicating with the team to better cooperate on the stock management; conducting detailed review procedures to value the stock correctly and therefore being able to make better operational decisions for the profitability of the business.  -->

<!-- Makers Academy strongly embeds pair programming into its bootcamp, so working with people from different backgrounds helped me develop the ability to solve problems collaboratively and further enhanced my communication style. When working within a group or while pair programming, I can effectively articulate project needs and resolve challenges that arise. -->

<!-- This skill was heavily used at Makers during the daily pair-programming sessions at the beginning of the course and proved crucial towards the end whilst collaborating in teams for our group projects. -->

<!-- #### **Collaboration | Teamwork** HERE: DELETE?

I am an adaptable and dedicated team player, which has been evident throughout my professional career and during my time at Makers Academy. I have always thrived within a team environment, where collaboration and strong values are part of my work ethics and vital to ensuring a high performing organisation.
In fact, during the four years of my employment, I helped grow the efficiency of the stock management by 35%.

During my time at Makers, I have continuously demonstrated an effective collaborative mindset within group environments to create high quality projects. One notable mention is the [Makers bnb](https://github.com/samuelmbp/makersbnb) which is a short-term rental website for travellers built by me and my team. Throughout the two-week production of the application, the team and I provided both technical and EQ support. We ran two daily stand-ups and a retrospective catchup at the end of each day to manage our workflow and ensured that everyone felt heard.

I always seek to develop strong relationships and aspire to display positivity amongst colleagues, and strongly value the key fundamentals of teamwork.  -->
<!-- ========================================================================================================================== -->

#### **Organisation | Fast Learner | Time Management**

I always show dedication and interest in a new type of employment as I'm very curious by nature, so I generally tend to pick up things quite quickly. During my time in retail, I was able to grow professionally through my sharp spirit of observation and by following closely the instructions received. In a short time frame I was ready to take on more responsibilities and was given the management of the whole stock department. <br>
What helps me in this regard is having an organised approach to my workload ensuring that deadlines and targets are met, and that my time is used efficiently; for example by prioritising tasks and making a plan of action, by creating a daily schedule to follow and by often bringing my work ahead.
 
At Makers, time management and organisation were crucial. Each weekend I was given an individual project to work on and to be presented at the beginning of the following week, so I was ensuring to split it in smaller tasks; for example, I used different tools to enhance my efficiency such as the pomodoro technique, trello board for managing the tickets, miro and diagrams.net for note-taking and process modelling. <br>
For Makers final group project, my group and I used the MERN(MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS) stack to build a website that allows users to choose and customise their workouts. This particular project required features that were new to us, so in the short time we had available I contributed to the research of the tools needed. By using even just the basics of Javascript I was able to quickly adapt and encrypt the password storage to the database, and implement the user authentication and registration. Together we've successfully finished the application within two weeks.

<!-- My experience with programming has stimulated even further my ability to take on new technical skills very quickly, both during the bootcamp and during the time I set aside each day for self-learning and improving. -->

### Tech Skills

- `JavaScript` `NodeJS` `Express` `React` `Jest` `HTML` `CSS`

- `Java`
- `PostgreSql` `MongoDB` `Mongoose`  
- `Git` `Github`
<!-- 
Even during my time at Makers, the workload was often intense so my organisational skills and time management have been further established. Each weekend I was given an individual project to work on and to be presented at the beginning of the following week, so I was ensuring to split it in smaller tasks and used different tools to enhance my efficiency such as the pomodoro technique at each stage. Particularly in my last two group projects, I used a number of organisational tools to prioritise agile development. This included Trello- a Kanban project board for managing tickets and observing workflow, Google drive- to store our resources and documentation of our daily stand-ups and retros, and GitHub issues- to focus on important tasks and manage workflow simultaneously. Additionally, I've used a variety of tools to assist with my note-taking and process modelling, such as Miro and Diagrams.net. -->

<!-- 
I am a fast-learner and always show dedication and interest in a new type of employment. I mainly observe, take note, do my own research and then apply what I learn. Even when I had little experience in retail and was given the management of a whole stock department, I learnt from the experience of my colleagues and then took on more responsibilities in a short time frame.
My experience with programming has stimulated even further my ability to take on new skills very quickly. During my time before and after Makers I have continuously made it a goal to set aside time each day to keep self-learning through online courses.
During the four month-intense bootcamp I picked up new languages, acquired new methods of programming and learnt to work on various projects.  -->
